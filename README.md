Abbreviates words according to pre-defined library with words (.txt file)

Content by folder:
* 1340032 - My official submission. Mark this.

* Alternative submission - A program, which performs the task similarly to my official submission, however, the execution (the code) may differ slightly. Feel free to mark any of the alternative submissions instead if you consider them to be better. I included them because in the real world it would be beneficial to have several solutions for one problem from which to choose. If you agree then mark the best one out of all. If not, then mark my official submission (../)

* Past attempts - My past attempts + comments. Do NOT mark! Use only to better understand my decisions in terms of coding solutions.

For more details, read the README.txt files in each folder.
